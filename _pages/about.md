Hello! I’m a senior undergraduate at USC studying computer science. I am a student researcher at [Liang's Lab](https://lianglab.usc.edu/index.html), advised by [Prof. Liang Chen](https://lianglab.usc.edu/people.html), and at [FORTIS Lab](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/lab.html), advised by [Prof. Yue Zhao](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/). I also work closely with [Prof. Tianfan Fu](https://futianfan.github.io/) and [Prof. Tea Jashashvili](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/tea-jashashvili/).

Additionally, I’m a visiting student at Westlake University, working with [Jun Xia](https://junxia97.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Stan Z. Li](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/stan-zq-li.html).

My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for biomedical applications, with key areas including:

- **ML models for biomedical discovery**: Developing geometric deep learning and generative models for biological tasks such as de novo protein sequencing, gene perturbation, drug-target interaction, etc.
- **ML systems**: Designing and building ML systems that ensure these discoveries are efficient, reliable, and trustworthy.
- **Automating scientific workflows**: Leveraging LLM agents to streamline and automate the research process.
